# CapstoneProject

Built a business data structure complete with ERD diagram, and data relationships. Data was gathered using Python(Web scrapping,  Faker). Deployed on AWS using RDS, and Lake Formation(S3, Glue). Data was then transferred to Redshift for querying. Users can view and call up company info and transaction data.
